Americano is a very interesting one!
The story goes, according to many sources that soldiers stationed in Italy during WWII were looking for a way to make the strong espresso they found there taste more like the coffee they were used to back in the States.

When the soldiers returned home they brought the Americano back with them. Up to this point, black coffee was the norm, so how did we come to embrace the Americano as a daily coffee staple?

Well they added *waterrrr*
