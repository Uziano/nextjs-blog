Deep work is a concept brought by **Cal Newport** in his book *deep work*. The main idea of the first chapter is to explain the importance of remain focus on each task we tackle individually even if we have tons of work pending.

When we intent to do *multitasking* we are just losing energy between activities instead of focusing long enough to finish the very first of them. So, if we are loosing energy shouldn't we be aware of it? YES, we are! Those little moments at watching a short video, answering an email or chatting drain our energy and we have to put more energy to "reaload" or concentration against the task.

Try to pay attention to that. And see what happends.
