Does perfection really exist? For some reason last time a thought I was perfect at something and inmediately prove myself wrong.
You can't be perfect, even with tons of experience.
Whenever you believe you have achieved perfection, you will stop persuing it, so, you just won't be. 
You will stay even far away from where you were, perfection is more like an state of flow, constantly changing and adapting and if you declare yourself as perfect you are even further than ever from it.

*Something shall never be perfect.*
Because then, **it dies**.
